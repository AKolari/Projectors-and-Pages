# Android Project 4 - *Projectors and Pages*

Submitted by: **Andi Kolari**

**Name of your app** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse ... [TODO] 

Time spent: **1** hour spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Choose any endpoint on The MovieDB API except `now_playing`**
  - Chosen Endpoint: `[trending/movie/week]`
- [X] **Make a request to your chosen endpoint and implement a RecyclerView to display all entries**
- [X] **Use Glide to load and display at least one image per entry**
- [X] **Click on an entry to view specific details about that entry using Intents**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Add another API call and RecyclerView that lets the user interact with different data.** 
- [ ] **Add rounded corners to the images using the Glide transformations**
- [ ] **Implement a shared element transition when user clicks into the details of a movie**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] I took the code from the in class project for week three, and used it to create a second component for the app that displays New York Times BestSeller books in a seperate fragment. I do not know if that counts as adding another API call, so I added it here
